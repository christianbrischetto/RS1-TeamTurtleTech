Person_Detect_Readme. 

** TO RUN 
move sprint for to src in ros2_ws. then: colcon build --packages-select sprint4
ros2 run sprint4 rgbDetect


the two main functions are detectRed() and detectBlue()
the prints at the end of each of these functions show you what params can be used to find person position in world space. currently they only work in the robots reference frame. 

the x axis is considered directly infront of the robot. 

these functions are called from within the odom callback

TODO 
**save recieved odom to a class odom_ member varible. 
**use this odom_ member varible and the (x,y) values present at the end of each function to determine persons position in world space.
