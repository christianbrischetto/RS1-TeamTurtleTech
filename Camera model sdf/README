Navigate to model.sdf file:
/ros2_ws/src/turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/models/turtlebot3_waffle_pi/model.sdf

First copy the original "model.sdf" file into another text editor. Call it "original model".

replace the original "model.sdf" file with the one I have added in this folder.

To make sure it i working export the waffle pi and run a world
run ros2 topic list and it should have the depth topics
Can also run: ros2 run rqt_image_view rqt_image_view and change the image view to the depth image


   What was changed on the turtlebot3_waffle_pi SDF:

     1) Add
          <joint name="camera_rgb_optical_joint" type="fixed">
            <parent>camera_rgb_frame</parent>
            <child>camera_rgb_optical_frame</child>
            <pose>0 0 0 -1.57079632679 0 -1.57079632679</pose>
            <axis>
              <xyz>0 0 1</xyz>
            </axis>
          </joint> 
     2) Rename <link name="camera_rgb_frame"> to <link name="camera_rgb_optical_frame">
     3) Add <link name="camera_rgb_frame"/>
     4) Change <sensor name="camera" type="camera"> to <sensor name="camera" type="depth">
     5) Change image width/height from 1920x1080 to 640x480
     6) Note that we can increase min scan range from 0.12 to 0.2 to avoid having scans 
        hitting the robot itself
     7) Change height of camera

I added comments in the model.sdf next to where stuff was changed
